# Overview
This React App is an exercise of using api data.
The main interface uses data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and lists all posts with the attached username of the user that has made the post. The second interface lists all users along with the nr of comments and posts they have posted along with the completed ToDos each coming from different endpoints of the api. If you click to the number of the posts for each user it takes you to another interface which lists all posts and their corresponding comments.
